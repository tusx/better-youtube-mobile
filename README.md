Better Mobile Youtube aims to provide a better user experience and more features for mobile Youtube on Firefox.

The extension is currently in the experimental stage so you may find bugs that still need to be fixed. It would be appreciated if you opened issues documenting any bugs or problems you run into.

At the moment there are no settings available for users to enable or disable features, all features are enabled.

## Installation Instructions
The extension can still be installed on Firefox for Android by visting the extension page and then using the "Add to Firefox" button.

To install extension from addons.mozilla.org follow this link: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-mobile-youtube/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-mobile-youtube/)
